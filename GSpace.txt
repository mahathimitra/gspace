GREENSPACE draft:

Problem: Global warming is a known issue. Everyone wants to protect nature. But unknowingly WE are contributing to it. People are not aware of how they are participating in global warming. We HAVE  to track and reduce our carbon footprint!

Solution: The app is helps to create awareness about your own daily contribution to global warming/greenhouse effect. Information about the contributing gases (CO2, CFCs, methane, etc.) from the daily activities is shown. It gives you a chance to reduce your carbon footprint. This app will also be a global hub for like-minded people who want to preseve nature. This is the go green community.
